### Revision 1
- The run is pretty fast, but it uses a lot of memory.
- Checked to make sure that the characters amount to something?
- Ok, there was a lot of data and I needed to go to bed.  More to come???

### Revision 2
- Going to try color counts in separate counters.
- The colors are in separate counters on the serial occurrence within the file.
- Though I do find it interesting that there are a lot of small numbers and ones in the file.  I do wonder if there really could be something embedded within the file?

### Revision 3
- Broke the "tests" out into their own classes.
- Simplified the program.cs file
- Wrote color report.
- Also since everything writes with a round # text file, I will just consolidate to one output folder.

### Revision 4
- Changing out the text files for ELK.
- The text files are just too large and numerous to look through cleanly.  I can do this better with discover (in progress).
- Added reverse bytes test after looking at the 05 image in a hex editor.
- No longer flush output directory.

### Revision 5
- Chucking a lot of work.  What I had was a mess.
- Working on a clearer vision of the analysis application.
- Dumping databases for text files for now.
- At least until I have a need for it.
- Working on other algos.

# TODO
## Menu
- Reintroduce the color counts to be safe.

## Algos
- LSB Algorithms (x and y) (7-bit, 8-bit) (gt0 and all)
- Color isolation algo
- Shedding circumference algo / w LSB (see above)
- BPCS?
- Byte output
