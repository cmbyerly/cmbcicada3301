# Observations
## Observation 0
- Width and height were pretty much uniform.  Nothing special about them.
- Got basic information, but showed pages with 2 or 3 colors to have in the hundreds of colors.  This is just anti-aliasing?

## Observation 1
- The color count stuff amounted to nothing.  Going back and working on some other algos.
